  Welcome to Arch Linux instructions for UEFI systems! Here you will find several instructions for the installation of Arch Linux in a simper way. All of these have been tested in VMs with the help of an admin (Skree) from the Manjaro's Discord server. 

  <br>Please keep in mind these are just instructions, anything that would happen to your machine while following these is not my responsibility, this has been of course tested on Oracle VM VirtualBox. 
  <br><br>These instructions would cover the installation of Arch Linux with installing these main packages:
  <br>- First is installing KDE with its essential packages.
  <br>- Second is installing Arch Linux with i3 and other lightweight packages, this is mainly for people who want a lightweight system. Packages here include: i3-gaps, rofi, lightdm and nitrogen.
  <br><br>If you’re using Oracle VM VirtualBox, after creating the VM and before running it, enable UEFI from the VM’s settings by going to the settings of the VM, then System, after that click on ‘Enable EFI (Special OSes only)’. If you use another VM, <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> how to do so.</b>
  <br><br>Before continuing, visit <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/" target="_blank">this link</a> to install the ISO from a server, it's usually named like "archlinux-2021.03.01-x86_64.iso". Then prepare an installation medium by checking <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Prepare_an_installation_medium" target="_blank">here</a>. After doing that boot the live environment by checking <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Boot_the_live_environment target="_blank">here</a>.
