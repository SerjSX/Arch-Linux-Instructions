# Arch-Linux-KDE-Instructions
These instructions are made by me and an admin from the Manjaro's Discord server helped me as well. This is for UEFI and 64bit systems only, not guaranteed working on others. More information are written in the site, visit the link that's above to access it.

### There are two available options:
- KDE: a minimal installation of one of the popular desktop environments, with a suite of software providing a full functional desktop.
- i3: a minimal installation and setup of a custom environment, with a suite of software providing a functional desktop.
